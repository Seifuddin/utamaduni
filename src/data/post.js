    content: `
      <p>At <strong>Utamaduni Charity</strong>, we believe that education is the foundation for lasting change. 
      Many communities we work with face barriers to quality education — from lack of resources to limited access to schools. 
      That’s why we launched the <em>Community Learning Program</em> to bring education closer to everyone.</p>

      <p>Our volunteers and teachers organize daily learning sessions in community centers, 
      where children and adults alike can read, write, and learn new skills such as coding, tailoring, and creative arts.</p>

      <p>Through these initiatives, we’ve seen children regain confidence, parents return to learning, 
      and entire families embrace a brighter future. Knowledge has truly become our strongest tool for empowerment.</p>

    content: `
      <p>Clean water is not just a necessity — it’s a right. 
      For years, communities around Mathare and surrounding areas have struggled with unsafe water sources, 
      leading to disease and poor hygiene. Utamaduni Charity stepped in with a mission: <strong>clean water for every home.</strong></p>

      <p>Through community partnerships, we drilled boreholes, installed filtration systems, 
      and provided education on water conservation and hygiene.</p>

      <p>Today, hundreds of families wake up to safe, clean water. 
      The joy in children’s faces as they fill their bottles is a powerful reminder that when we unite for good, 
      we can change lives — one drop at a time.</p>

    content: `
      <p>Food insecurity is one of the most pressing challenges faced by many families in informal settlements. 
      The <strong>Utamaduni Food and Nutrition Drive</strong> was born out of compassion and a shared vision to 
      ensure that no child is left hungry or malnourished.</p>

      <p>Every month, our volunteers distribute food packages and host community cooking days, 
      where families come together to share meals, stories, and smiles. 
      Beyond feeding bodies, we aim to nourish minds and hearts.</p>

      <p>Our work has fed thousands and inspired many to join hands. 
      Because at Utamaduni, we believe that together, we can create a future where every plate is full — 
      and every heart is too.</p>
